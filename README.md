# Conway's Game of Life

This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life built with p5.js. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

## Features

- Interactive canvas to visualize the Game of Life.
- Start button to control the simulation.
- Button are styled and include hover effects.
- Canvas and control buttons are centered in the window.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to start the simulation.
- Live Website: https://mehmetkahya0.github.io/Conways-Game-of-Life/
## Controls

- Click the "Start Game" button to start the simulation.

## About Conway's Game of Life

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
